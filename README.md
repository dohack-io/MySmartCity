## What benefit will your work bring in smart city context?

### Now:

Citizens have to go to different offices for their form e.g. Renew driver license -> Driver license office or Renew identity card -> Town Hall.

Each office has its own opening hours and this is very complicated for citizens.

### SmartCity:

In a SmartCityworld there is only one virtual office left!.
This office has all the forms of the city.

A citizen fills an application form and the respective employee of the city works on this.
The citizen knows through the app the dates and the status
